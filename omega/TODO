- Add planets that unlock biomes with their own type of "shards" (crystals)
  - shards can build ships
  
(ie. ice planet, ice biome, ice shards, and ice ship, but with cool names ofc)


- Using Pusher for leaderboard, have the client only send a message to the server (event `updateHighscore`) if the
  highscore is greater than their own client highscore (to minimize calls)

- Change music for Hugo to something more elctronic to fit in with other music (Player Suggested)
